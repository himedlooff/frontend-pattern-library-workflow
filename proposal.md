**Title:**
How introducing pattern libraries into your front-end workflow can change you

**Description:**
Introducing a pattern library into your front-end workflow can be a huge benefit
to not only front-end developers, but also your entire team.
This session will examine Mike's experiences bringing a pattern library concept into his workflow.
It will cover his baby steps like _thinking patterns-first_ and creating a simple _page-o-patterns_.
He'll cover experiments with using GitHub Pages and the GitHub API
to host a pattern library with contextual issue tracking.
Evolving, he'll explore adding documentation and implementing a pattern library generator into a task runner-based workflow.
Finally, Mike admits his pattern library obsession and shares the culmination of his journey so far,
creating his own open source pattern library parser Dox-ray,
setting him on a path, which will someday lead him to attaining pattern library nirvana.

**Abstract:**
Introducing a pattern library into your front-end workflow can be a huge benefit
to not only front-end developers, but also your entire team.
A pattern library helps raise awareness of what does and doesn't exist
which is helpful when onboarding new team members and planning new pages or features.
It streamlines front-end code testing and helps promote code consistency and re-use, which minimizes redundancy.
It makes front-end code more approachable and usable by other team members,
even non-technical team members, making the front-end developer less of a blocker.

This session will examine Mike's experiences bringing a pattern library concept into his workflow
and the lasting impact it has left on him.
It will cover his baby steps like _thinking patterns-first_ and creating a simple _page-o-patterns_.
He'll cover experiments with using GitHub Pages and the GitHub API
to host a pattern library with contextual issue tracking.
Evolving, he'll explore adding documentation and implementing a pattern library generator into a task runner-based workflow.
Finally, Mike admits his pattern library obsession and shares the culmination of his journey so far,
creating his own open source pattern library parser Dox-ray,
setting him on a path, which will someday lead him to attaining pattern library nirvana.
