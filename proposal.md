Introducing pattern libraries into your front-end workflow

Introducing a pattern library into your front-end workflow can be a huge benefit to not only front-end developers,
but your entire team.
The library helps raise awareness of what does and doesn't exist
which is helpful when onboarding new team members and planning new pages or features.
It streamlines front-end code testing and helps promotoe code re-use which minimizes redundacy.
The pattern library makes front-end code more approachable and usable by other team members,
even non-technical team members, making the front-end developer less of a blocker.

This talk will examine Mike's experiences with introducing the pattern library concept into his workflow
by sharing baby steps like _thinking patterns-first_ and creating a simple page-o-patterns,
to more advanced steps like incorporating a pattern library generator into a task runner like Grunt
and even creating your own custom-structured pattern library generator and plugins.
