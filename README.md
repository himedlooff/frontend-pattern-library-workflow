# pattern-based-dev-notes

- Analyze the design and spot new patterns.
- Build the patterns first.
- Document and collect them into a pattern library as you build them, not after you're done building the design. Use tools like Topdoc or Dox-ray. Use task runners like Grunt to help with this process.
- Build out the design using the patterns you created.
- Think "reusable" first, instead of "page-specific" first. It's easier to have a one-off pattern than it is to go back and refactor patterns that you thought were page-specific.
